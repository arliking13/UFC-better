# UFC-better
The UFC Bet Tracker tracks the progress of your bets and calculates the profits that you've made through each simulation.

Run Down:
1. The website first directs the user to the T&C website where the user must accept the terms and conditions before proceeding onto the next webpage.
2. Once the T&C is fulfilled the user will then be directed to the Profile page where they will have an selection of 6 different avaters and an option to enter their username.
3. The user then is directed to the Homepage where they will see their current net profits and where they can access quick links such as "bets" and "fights".
4. When the user chooses "bets" the user will be directed to an page where they will be able to select two fighters and set the x amount of dollars they want to bet with. Once the user enter two fighters and simulates the fight (or uses a real result), then the "ODDS", "WINNER", "PROFIT", and "RESULTS" will be printed on screen with their respective information such as "WINNER" containing the name of the winner and "PROFITS" the x amount of dollars the user has gained or lost in the fight. The API for the fighters was used through this link: https://www.octagon-api.com/athlete. Note: Make sure to enter the fighters name correctly or else the webpage will not recongize it.
5. Once the user is finish with bets they can then go over to "fights" where it will show an history of simulated fights that they had done and show the information from that fight.
